- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## API Endpoints

  "message": "How many employees do we have?",
  "conversation_id": "optional_conversation_id"
}
```

**Response:**

## Available Tools

HRMS Buddy can access the following HRMS functions:

- **get_all_employee**: Get list of all employees with their information
- **get_my_profile**: Get the current user's profile information

## Frontend Integration

The chatbot is integrated with the React frontend. Make sure both servers are running:

1. **Backend (HRMS Buddy)**: http://localhost:8000
2. **Frontend (React)**: http://localhost:5173

## How It Works

1. **User Query**: User sends a natural language query
2. **Planning**: AI analyzes the query and creates an execution plan
3. **Tool Selection**: AI selects appropriate HRMS API tools
4. **Execution**: Tools are called to fetch relevant data
5. **Response**: AI formulates a natural language response

## Example Queries

- "How many employees do we have?"
- "Show me my profile information"
- "What is the current employee count?"
- "Tell me about the HR team"

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Verify OpenAI API key in .env file
- Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the HRMS backend API is accessible
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API credentials are correct

### Chat Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- Verify CORS settings allow your frontend origin

## Development

To extend HRMS Buddy with new tools:

1. Add new API functions in `fastapi_server.py`
2. Update the `available_tools` dictionary
3. Update the system prompt with tool descriptions
4. Test the new functionality

## Security Notes

- Keep your OpenAI API key secure and never commit it to version control
- The current setup uses hardcoded HRMS credentials - consider implementing proper authentication
- In production, use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
